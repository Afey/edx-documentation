######################################################
Setting up Discussions in Courses with Cohorts
######################################################

In courses that have cohorts enabled, you can set up discussion topics to be
either divided by cohort, or unified and accessible to all students.

When you first enable cohorts in your course, the initial behavior for 
:ref:`course-wide discussion topics<Coursewide Discussion Topics and Cohorts>` 
is different from the behavior of :ref:`content-specific discussion topics
<Content Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts>`.

By default, course-wide discussion topics are unified because these
discussions are generally used for posts that are of broad interest to all
learners in the course. In contrast, content-specific discussion topics are by
default divided by cohort. You can change discussion topics of either type to
be divided or unified. In addition, you can :ref:`change the default
setting<Specify the Default Behavior for ContentSpecific Discussion Topics>`
for content-specific discussion topics, so that new content-specific
discussion topics are created the way that works best for your course.

For information about discussion topics and cohorts, see the following topics:

.. _Coursewide Discussion Topics and Cohorts:

***********************************************
Course-Wide Discussion Topics and Cohorts
***********************************************

When you first :ref:`create a course-wide discussion topic<Create CourseWide
Discussion Topics>`, it is unified, and all students in the course can post,
read, respond, and comment in the topic without regard to their cohort
assignments. 

After you add a course-wide topic, you can configure it so that it is divided by
cohort instead. For step-by-step instructions for specifying whether a course-
wide discussion topic is unified or divided by cohort, see :ref:`Specify Whether
CourseWide Discussion Topics are Cohorted`.

====================================================================
Example: Making Some Course-Wide Discussion Topics Divided by Cohort
====================================================================

Course-wide discussion topics are by default unified, so that all learners can
participate. In some instances, however, you might decide that it makes sense to
divide some course-wide discussion topics by cohort, so that members of each
cohort only see and respond to cohort-specific posts.

For example, in addition to the system-supplied General topic, you add three
new course-wide discussion topics, for a total of four discussion topics.

* General
* Course Q&A
* Announcements
* Brainstorming

The posts that you intend to make to the General and Course Q&A topics, and the
subjects you expect students to explore there, are appropriate for a unified
learner audience. However, you decide that it will be useful for the
Announcements and Brainstorming topics to be divided by cohort.

You also decide to apply a naming convention so that students will know the
audience for the discussion topics before they add any posts. For information
about naming conventions, see :ref:`Apply Naming Conventions to Discussion
Topics`.


.. _Specify Whether CourseWide Discussion Topics are Cohorted:

********************************************************************
Specify Whether Course-Wide Discussion Topics are Divided by Cohort
********************************************************************

When you :ref:`create course-wide discussion topics<Create CourseWide
Discussion Topics>`, they are by default unified, and all learners in the
course can see and respond to posts from all other learners. You can change
course-wide discussion topics to be divided by cohort, so that only members of
the same cohort can see and respond to each other's posts.

To change the cohort settings for course-wide discussion topics, follow these
steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 
   
#. In the **Course-Wide Discussion Topics** section, select the checkbox next to
   each course-wide discussion topic that you want to divide by cohort. Clear
   the checkbox next to each course-wide discussion topic that you want to make
   unified.
   
#. Click **Save**.
   
   The list of course-wide discussion topics is updated to show which topics are
   divided by cohort, and which are unified.

For more information about managing discussions that are divided by cohort, see
:ref:`Moderating Discussions for Cohorts`.


.. _Content Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts:

**********************************************
Content-Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts
**********************************************

When you enable the cohort feature for a course, and :ref:`create content-
specific discussion topics<Create ContentSpecific Discussion Topics>` by adding
discussion components to units in Studio, these content-specific discussion
topics are by default divided by cohort. A student who is assigned to one
cohort cannot read or add to the posts, responses, or comments contributed
by the members of another cohort.

If you want all content-specific discussion topics in your course to remain
divided by cohort, you do not need to take any further action. However, if you
want to make one of more content-specific discussion topics unified
(accessible to all students regardless of cohort), or if you :ref:`want all
future content- specific discussion topics to be unified<Specify the Default
Behavior for ContentSpecific Discussion Topics>` when you first add them in a
course, you can :ref:`change the settings<Specify Whether ContentSpecific
Discussion Topics are Cohorted>` in the Instructor Dashboard.


For more information and instructions for specifying whether a content-specific
discussion topic is unified or divided by cohort, see :ref:`Specify Whether
ContentSpecific Discussion Topics are Cohorted`.


.. _Specify the Default Behavior for ContentSpecific Discussion Topics:

*******************************************************************
Specify the Default Behavior for Content-Specific Discussion Topics
*******************************************************************

The default behavior for content-specific discussion topics is that they are
divided by cohort when you first :ref:`add them<Create ContentSpecific
Discussion Topics>` in your courseware.

You can change the default setting so that when you add new content-specific
discussion topics in your course, they are by default unified. 


To change the default setting for content-specific discussion topics, follow
these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 
   
#. Select one of the two options for how content-specific discussion topics are
   created by default:

 * To have content-specific discussion topics created as divided by cohort,
   select **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics**.

   All content-specific discussion topics that you now create in your course
   outline are divided by cohort. If you have this option selected, you
   cannot change the cohort settings of individual content-specific
   discussion topics.

 * To have content-specific discussion topics created by default as unified,
   select **Cohort only selected content-specific discussion topics**.

   All content-specific discussion topics that you now create in your course
   outline are unified. If you have this option selected, you can
   :ref:`change the cohort setting<Specify Whether Content-Specific
   Discussion Topics are Divided by Cohort>` of individual content-specific
   discussion topics.
  
4. Click **Save**.
   
.. note:: The **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics** setting
   overrides the cohort setting for existing content-specific discussion
   topics as well as any that you create after you select this option. If the
   **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics** option is selected,
   you cannot change the cohort settings of individual content-specific
   discussion topics.

   If you change the setting from **Cohort some content-specific discussion
   topics** back to **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics**, all
   content-specific discussion topics are divided by cohort, regardless of their
   previous setting. Content-specific discussions that were previously unified
   are still shown as unified in the list, but their cohort setting is
   overridden by the setting, and you can no longer edit the cohort setting of
   individual content-specific discussion topics.


For information about managing discussions that are divided by cohort, see
:ref:`Moderating Discussions for Cohorts`.


.. _Specify Whether ContentSpecific Discussion Topics are Cohorted:

*************************************************************************
Specify Cohort Settings for Individual Content-Specific Discussion Topics
*************************************************************************

When you create content-specific discussion topics, whether they are initially
divided by cohort or unified depends on your current default setting.

* If you have **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics** selected,
  when you add discussion components to your course in Studio, the resulting
  discussion topics are divided by cohort. Only members of the same cohort can
  see and respond to each other's posts.

  If **Always cohort content-specific discussion topics** is selected, you
  cannot use the list of content-specific discussion topics in the Instructor
  Dashboard to change the cohort setting for individual content-specific
  topics. This setting acts an as override, and all content-specific
  discussion topics are divided by cohort.

  .. note:: If you change the setting from **Cohort only selected content-
     specific discussion topics** back to **Always cohort content-specific
     discussion topics**, all content-specific discussion topics are divided
     by cohort, regardless of their previous setting. Content-specific
     discussions that were previously unified are still shown as unified in
     the list, but their cohort setting is overridden by the setting, and you
     can no longer edit the cohort setting of individual content-specific
     discussion topics.

* If you have **Cohort only selected content-specific discussion topics**
  selected, when you add discussion components to your course in Studio, the
  resulting discussion topics are unified, and all students can view and respond
  to them, regardless of the cohort they belong to.

  If **Cohort only selected content-specific discussion topics** is selected,
  the list of content-specific discussion topics in the Instructor Dashboard
  is editable, and you can change the cohort setting for individual content-
  specific discussion topics.


.. warning:: If you change the cohort settings of discussion topics after
   learners have begun reading and contributing to discussion posts, you are
   changing their course experience. Learners might see posts that were
   previously not visible to them, or they might no longer see posts that were
   previously available to all learners. If you make changes to cohort
   settings in a running course, be aware of the implications of such changes.
   For more details, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.


To change the cohort settings for individual content-specific discussion
topics, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 
   
#. In the **Content-Specific Discussion Topics** section, if it is not already
   selected, select **Cohort only selected content-specific discussion topics**.

   The list of content-specific discussion topics becomes editable. 
   
#. Clear the checkbox next to each content-specific discussion topic that you
   want to make unified. Select the checkbox next to each content-specific
   discussion topic that you want to divide by cohort.
   
#. Click **Save**.
   
   The list of content-specific discussion topics is updated to show which
   topics are divided by cohort, and which are unified.
